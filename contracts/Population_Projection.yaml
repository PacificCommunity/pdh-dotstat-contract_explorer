    Pre-dissemination data ready for ingestion in .Stat .
    SPC validated population projection for the Pacific area. 
    All population estimates, projections or forecasts per country, per age, per sex, per year in the Pacific region. 
    Estimates from 1950 to the current year and projections/forecasts to 2050.
    All derived data (e.g., total population projection, projection for age groups, sex, sub-regions...) are computed by Population projections by SDD - SID - Data Systems
