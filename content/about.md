# About 

This is an experimental website to explore the use of data contracts in the context of the Pacific Data Hub.
It is not an official website of the Pacific Community, and the data contracts are not official documents of the Pacific Community.

It was build by me, Giulio Dalla Riva, in Rust.

The wonderfully simple statitic-site generator is called [Marmite](https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite), by Bruno Rocha.
The repository is using this [template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/blog).

The logic of yaml to md preprocessing is in the `/preprocess` rust cargo, and it's all my fault.
