# Intro

At PDH.Stat we take good care of all data we collect, process, and disseminate.

To be better at tracing provenance and ensuring data quality, we are experimenting with a new feature: data contracts.

This are rather detailed, technical documents that map the flows of data from the source to the final products.
The contracts are negotiational, meaning that they are agreed upon by all parties involved in the data processing.
And they are living documents, meaning that they are updated as the data processing evolves.

Not to reinvent the wheel, we adopted a recognised standard for data contracts specification, available [here](https://datacontract.com).

## This repository

is where we store all data contracts for the data we process:
- the raw yaml files can be found in the `/contracts/` directory.
- this website also provides a user-friendly interface to browse and discover the contracts [here](https://pacificcommunity.github.io/pdh-dotstat-contract_explorer/).

## How to contribute

If you are a data producer, data processor, or data user, you are welcome to contribute to the data contracts.

Actually, we encourage you to do so, as this will help us all to better understand the data we work with.
